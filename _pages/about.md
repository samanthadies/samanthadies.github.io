I am a second year PhD student at Northeastern University in [Khoury College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) affiliated with the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/). I am advised by [Professor Tina Eliassi-Rad](http://eliassi.org/). My interests include attacking problems at the intersection of computer science and ethics, particularly those relating to social media, using a variety of machine learning techniques.

I graduated from Georgetown University in 2022 with a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science with a minor in Spanish. As an undergrad, I was advised by [Professor Lisa Singh](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~singh/) as a research scholar at the McCourt School of Public Policy's [Massive Data Institute](https://mdi.georgetown.edu/).
